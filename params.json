{"name":"Spotify Menubar","tagline":"A simple app that lets you assign global hotkeys to control spotify.","body":"There are a few good remotes that can be found on the App Store now, but you can still download Spotify Menubar.\r\n\r\n[Download Spotify Menubar](http://lifeupnorth.co.uk/files/Spotify_Menubar.zip)  \r\n[Download the Simbl Plugin](http://lifeupnorth.co.uk/files/SIMBL%20Plugin%20\\(Spotify\\).zip)\r\n\r\nThank you. :)\r\n\r\n### What is it?\r\nSpotify Menubar lets you assign global keyboard shortcuts to the play/pause, skip forward and skip back functions in Spotify. It also gives you the option of miniature controls in the menubar.\r\n\r\nThe SIMBL plugin uses the keybinds defined in the app and applies them only when Spotify is launched, which means Spotify Menubar doesn't need to be open all the time.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nWhen you first open Spotify Menubar you will be presented with a welcome window showing where Spotify Menubar is typically located (though you can choose whether you want to show or hide the dock/menubar icons).\r\n\r\nThe options to show/hide the menubar or dock icon can be found in the preferences. The global shortcuts can also be customised from the preferences.\r\n\r\nInstructions regarding the SIMBL plugin can be found in the preferences. SIMBL plugins are located in:\r\n```\r\nHD > Library > Application Support > SIMBL > Plugins\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nUser > Library > Application Support > SIMBL > Plugins\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Trouble?
